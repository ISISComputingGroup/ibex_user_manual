Banner
######

The Banner is located at the bottom of the IBEX GUI window.

The Banner displays information about the current status of the IBEX GUI. For instance, it displays the name of the current configuration.

The Banner also displays important status information about selected devices on an instrument. It is customisable on an instrument by instrument basis. For example, on LARMOR, the Banner is customised to display a message indicating whether any motors are moving and to display a message if the bump strip has been tripped. On IMAT, the Banner is customised to display the current position of the beam attenuator device.

Please discuss how you would like the Banner to be customised for your instrument with the Experiment Controls team.
