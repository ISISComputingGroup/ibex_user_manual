# Scripting

There are two ways of running scripts in IBEX - locally, and on the IBEX server.

Scripting in IBEX is done using python, with the genie\_python library. The `genie\_python reference manual`_ gives a full account of what functions are available in genie\_python.

This page is intended to give a broad guide to scripting for the
beginner and novice user. For a more in-depth discussion, see our [[genie_python and IBEX training course|genie_python-and-Ibex-(Introduction)]].

If you are new to Python, the Mantid team has created an excellent `Introduction to Python 
<http://www.mantidproject.org/Introduction_To_Python>`_ on the Mantid website.
