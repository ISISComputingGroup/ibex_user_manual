# Scripting

There are two ways of running scripts in IBEX - locally, and on the IBEX server.

Scripting in IBEX is done using python, with the `genie_python` library. The the {external+genie_python:py:mod}`genie` reference documentation gives a full account of what functions are available in `genie_python`.

This page is intended to give a broad guide to scripting for the
beginner and novice user. For a more in-depth discussion, see our [genie_python and IBEX training course](scripting/training_course/genie_python-and-IBEX-(Introduction)).

There is some specific [scripting advice for the Muon Front End](/inst_specific/Guidance-on-Writing-Scripts-for-the-Muon-Front-End)

If you are new to Python, the Mantid team has created an excellent [Introduction to Python](http://www.mantidproject.org/Introduction_To_Python>) on the Mantid website.
