What is IBEX
############

IBEX is the name of a suite of software which helps to control the beamlines for experiments at ISIS, as well as generating the data files which are then digested and made available via the ISIS Data Gateway (https://data.isis.stfc.ac.uk/datagateway).

IBEX consists of a server and Graphical User Interface (GUI) system, which can be run on separate computers if appropriate. 

IBEX uses python as its scripting language. genie_python is a python library that allows the scripts written for IBEX to match closely in format to those in the previous control system used at ISIS.
