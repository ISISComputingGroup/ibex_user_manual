Navigating Synoptic Views
=========================

In IBEX, synoptic views provide you with interactive, schematic views of your instrument.  Each icon on a synoptic view represents a device attached to your instrument.  You can tailor the synoptic view to display key PVs next to the device icons.  By double-clicking on an item, you can drill down to see more detail.

The focus of this page is navigating synoptic views.  If you wish to create your own synoptic view see [[CreateandManageSynoptics]].
