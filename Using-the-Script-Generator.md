Here we will talk you through what you need to know to use the script generator.

1. This table may not appear in your script generator. However, if it does this means there have been errors loading some of your configs. The error message may tell you there is an error in one of your configs (action definitions) or there has been an error loading from a specific location.
2. From the drop-down here you may select a config (action definition) to use to generate a script.
3. Clicking on this button will bring up a message box describing at least some of the errors when validating the contents of the script generator table.
4. Hovering over a row that is invalid (highlighted in red and with a cross mark in the validation column) will display the reason this row is invalid. This reason is defined in the config.
5. The validity column will contain a cross and be coloured a deeper red if the row is invalid.
