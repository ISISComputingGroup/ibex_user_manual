Here we will talk you through what you need to know to use the script generator.

1. This table may not appear in your script generator. However, if it does this means there have been errors loading some of your configs. The error message may tell you there is an error in one of your configs (action definitions) or there has been an error loading from a specific location.
2. From the drop-down here you may select a config (action definition) to use to generate a script.
3. Clicking on this button will bring up a message box describing at least some of the errors when validating the contents of the script generator table.
4. Hovering over a row that is invalid (highlighted in red and with a cross mark in the validation column) will display the reason this row is invalid. This reason is defined in the config.
5. The validity column will contain a cross and be coloured a deeper red if the row is invalid.
6. The validity column will contain a tick and be coloured green if the row is valid.
7. Select a row and press the up or down button to reorder rows.
8. The script generator table is to contain the experimental parameters that will be used by the generated script.
9. Create a new action (row in the script generator table) with the "Add Action" button.
10. Select an action in the table by clicking on the row and click the "Delete Action" button to delete the row.
