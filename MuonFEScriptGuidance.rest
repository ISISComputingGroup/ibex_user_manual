Guidance on Writing Scripts for the Muon Front-End
===================================================

This page contains guidance on writing scripts for the Muon Front-End control PC (NDEMUONFE).  The information on this page is specific to NDEMUONFE and is not relevant to other control PCs.

Starting & Stopping Runs Remotely
---------------------------------

The relevant code can be found in the github repository:

https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/mfe_control_scripts

The code is written in Python and relies on the win32com module. Please ensure this is installed before running.

There is a file, run_interactively.py, which can be used to interactively trigger commands on multiple machines. It is currently set up to run on the 3 MFE instrument PCs. You can adjust it by changing the list of machine names in the variable MACHINES. To run just launch the script with Python.

Note that the script relies on the host machine and user having sufficient DCOM permissions to talk to the three instrument machines. This can be best achieved through the Windows credential manager. 

1. Go to the start menu
2. Type "Credential Manager" and open the Credential Manager
3. You will need credentials for all the machines you want to connect to. The "Persistence" field for the credentials must be "Enterprise" or higher (not "Local machine").
4. To add a new credential
    1. Click "Add a Windows credential"
    2. Enter the credentials (e.g. NDXMUSR, NDXMUSR\\spudulike, [PASSWORD])
    3. Click "OK"

To write your own scripts, use the MultipleDaeController class in Python to issue commands to multiple machines simultaneously. The script run_interactively.py provides a good example of how to use it.

Insert documentation explaining how to start/stop runs on each instrument remotely.

::

    from multiple_dae_controller import MultipleDaeController
    controller = MultipleDaeController()
    waitfor_seconds = 10
    for m in ["NDXHIFI","NDXMUSR","NDXEMU"]:
        controller.add_machine(m,waitfor_seconds)
    controller.run_on_all("get_run_state")
    controller.run_on_machines("end",["NDXHIFI","NDXMUSR"])
    controller.run_on_machine("begin","NDXEMU")

The following methods are currently supported:

- begin
- end
- pause
- resume
- abort
- get_run_state
- get_events
- get_frames
- get_counts
- waitfor_counts
- waitfor_frames
- waitfor_events

How to Re-apply Settings
------------------------

IOCs controlling Power Supply Units have the option to re-apply their set-points (current, voltage, status on/off) the next time they are restarted.

To do this, the relevant configuration must be setup in the following way:

#. Open the Edit Configuration dialog (by selecting ``Configurations > Edit`` from the ``Configuration`` menu).
#. In the ``IOCs`` tab, locate the correct IOC and make sure both the ``Auto-start?`` and ``Auto-restart?`` boxes for the IOC are checked.
#. In the ``IOC Macros`` tab, select the correct IOC and set the macro ``SP_AT_STARTUP`` to ``YES`` (default is ``NO``).

The set-points can be re-applied by reloading the current configuration (which will restart the IOCs), with the following genie_python command:

::

   reload_current_config()

Note that the set-points can also be re-applied by restarting the IOCs individually in the IBEX GUI (as long as the ``SP_AT_STARTUP`` macro is set as above).
