The web dashboard (or data web) is a basic webpage that will give you information about the state of your instrument.

It can be found at http://dataweb.isis.rl.ac.uk/

The view is read only and gives you a dashboard in a similar style to the desktop GUI as well as general instrument data and information on blocks. There is a checkbox at the bottom of the screen to show/hide hidden blocks.

If you do not wish to have the title/users visible on this page you can set this via the desktop GUI in the DAE perspective -> Run Summary.

The block names displayed should be hyperlinks to a block history display plot - if they are not, you probably just need to clear you browserâ€™s cached images and files. Access to the block history requires a username and password: 
* For ISIS staff, enter your federal ID username (or stfc email address), and password
* For ISIS Users, you should enter your ISIS user office login details. In addition, you need to have created a visit (even if you are not coming to site) at https://users.facilities.rl.ac.uk/visits covering the dates that your experiment is in progress.

For ISIS staff there is an enhanced plotting option available via the [Grafana Dashboard](Grafana-Dashboard)
