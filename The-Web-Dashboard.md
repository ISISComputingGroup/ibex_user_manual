The web dashboard (or data web) is a basic webpage that will give you information about the state of your instrument.

It can be found at dataweb.isis.rl.ac.uk/IbexDataweb/default.html?Instrument=_my instrument name_

The view is read only and gives you a dashboard in a similar style to the desktop GUI as well as general instrument data and information on blocks. There is a checkbox at the bottom of the screen to show/hide hidden blocks.

If you do not wish to have the title/users visible on this page you can set this via the desktop GUI in the DAE perspective -> Run Summary.
