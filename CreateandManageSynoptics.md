Create & Manage Synoptic Views
==============================

In IBEX, synoptic views provide you with interactive, schematic views of your instrument.  Each icon on a synoptic view represents a device attached to your instrument.  You can tailor the synoptic view to display key PVs next to the device icons.   By double-clicking on an item, you can drill down to see more detail.

You can define as many synoptic views as you wish for your instrument.  Each synoptic need not encompass the whole instrument.  You can define synoptic views that focus on specific aspects of your instrument - for example, just the beam optics, or just the sample stack and equipment mounted on the sample stack.

You can also associate a synoptic view with a particular configuration, so that, in effect, the synoptic becomes the default synoptic for that configuration.

Creating a Synoptic View
------------------------

To create a synoptic view:

#. Select ``New`` from the ``Synoptic menu.
#. IBEX displays a dialog divided into four panes.  

   #. Instrument Tree
   #. Component Details
   #. Component  Target Details
   #. PV Details

We'll describe each of these in turn.
