ISIS staff are able to access an enhanced web dashboard plotting mechanism via the site https://svr2.nd.rl.ac.uk/grafana/ - login must be by federal id (without clrc prefix). 

## Plotting multiple traces 

Once logged in, if you click on the "compass" icon on the left (called "explore") at the top of the page you will then see a "metrics" menu where you can choose a logged item from an instrument. After that, you can then add further queries to the same graph. These additions are then remembered in the "query history", when you "clear all" it starts a new item in the query history. This query history is per browser, so if you log in again with the same browser you should be able to go straight to a previous query you made (query history is saved for a few weeks). If you add multiple traces to a graph, you can click on individual trace names displayed below the graph to see just that line, and then “control click” to re-add additional lines.
