- Sets the value for a particular block
    - Assumes that either a setpoint exists for the underlying value or the block itself points at a setpoint
    - Can be called with block names as named arguments. This is useful for setting multiple blocks
        - Example: ``g.cset(MY_BLOCK=1, MY_OTHER_BLOCK=2)``
    - The block can also be passed in by name. This is useful when setting advanced block properties
        - Example: ``g.cset("MY_BLOCK", lowlimit=1, highlimit=10, runcontrol=True)``
