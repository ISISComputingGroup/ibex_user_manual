The Script Server
=================

IBEX features a script server, which allows you to write scripts and submit them to the server to run. This allows you to queue multiple scripts which the server will execute for you.

To access this feature, select 'Script Server' on the left-hand menu. This perspective allows you to create and queue scripts, as well as show you which script is currently running and how far it is through its execution.

You can write the script within IBEX, or load a pre-written Python script from elsewhere on the system. You can also save scripts that you have written within IBEX.

Note that you cannot create graphs from the Script Server.
