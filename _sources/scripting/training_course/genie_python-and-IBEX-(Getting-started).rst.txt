Starting a scripting session
============================

From IBEX
---------

The best way to run ``genie_python`` commands is from the scripting perspective of the IBEX client.

To open a scripting window:

1. Start the IBEX client
2. Open the scripting perspective

.. image:: ../OpenTheScriptingPerspective.png

3. From here, you can start entering Python code. It will be executed line by line as you enter it.

Outside IBEX
------------

You can also open a scripting terminal by running ``C:\Instrument\Apps\Python\genie_python.bat`` but this is recommended for advanced users only.
