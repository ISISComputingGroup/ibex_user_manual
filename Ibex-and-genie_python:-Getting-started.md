Starting a scripting session
============================

From Ibex
---------

The best way to run ``genie_python`` commands is from the scripting perspective of the Ibex client.

To open a scripting window:

1. Start the Ibex client
2. Open the scripting perspective

::
    IMAGE: OpenTheScriptingPerspective

3. From here, you can start entering Python code. It will be executed line by line as you enter it.

**Exercise 1**
--------------

- Open a scripting window in Ibex
- Output "Hello, world!" to the console
- Calculate and output the square of all the integers between 1 and 10

Outside Ibex
------------

You can also open a scripting terminal by running ``C:\Instrument\Apps\Python\genie_python.bat``. This will not provide some advanced features such as auto-complete though, and is recommended for advanced users only.
